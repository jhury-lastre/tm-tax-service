# Tax Management Calculator

A comprehensive tax management application built with Turborepo, designed to help manage client tax scenarios and perform tax calculations. This application provides an intuitive interface for tax professionals to manage client information, track income sources, and calculate tax liabilities.

## üöÄ Quick Start

To start the development server for all applications:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- **Web App** (port 3001): Main tax calculator application
- **API** (port 3000): Backend API for client and income management  
- **Docs** (port 3000): Documentation and demo site

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- PostgreSQL database
- npm >= 10

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tm-calculator
   npm install
   ```

2. **Database Setup:**
   ```sh
   # Create a PostgreSQL database
   createdb tm_calculator
   
   # Set your database URL in the API environment
   # Create apps/api/.env with:
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/tm_calculator
   ```

3. **Start development servers:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will automatically seed the database with sample data on first run.
